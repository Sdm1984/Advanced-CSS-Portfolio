        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Stephanie Mathis is originally from Pinewood, South Carolina and she currently works in international education at Emory University. Stephanie's journey began through FSU’s 
            rigorous Urban Regional Planning Panama program where she discovered her passion for education and adventure during a stay in the Comarca region with the Kuna Yala Indians. 
            In addition, she spent a tenure with the National Society of Black Engineers in Alexandria, Virginia, in which she managed NSBE’s international student membership and programs. 
            
          <p>  The experience was transformative in so many ways – and Stephanie fell in love with the field and working with students from all over the world. 
          In her free time, she enjoys trying new organic beauty products, shopping at farmers markets, exploring Atlanta’s music and food scene, and spending time with family and friends. </p>   </p>
